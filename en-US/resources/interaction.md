## Events

### interaction/button

Triggered when a button of type `action` is clicked. Required resource: [`button`](#def-button).

### interaction/command

Triggered when a slash command is invoked. At least one of the resources [`argv`](#def-argv) or `message` must be included.

::: tip
Many platforms support slash commands, but their implementations vary. If the platformâ€™s slash commands are only provided on the frontend and the bot cannot directly determine whether an event is a slash command invocation, it can be treated as a regular message event.
